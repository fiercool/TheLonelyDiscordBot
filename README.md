# TheLonelyDiscordBot
My discord bot, uploaded to github. 

## How to run. 
### How to make a discord bot. 
Firstly set up a discord bot by going [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
Then click "New Application" in the top right, and pick any name you'd like. 
Click on the bot tab, and add a bot. 
Then copy the token as we'll need it for later.

## How to start hosting
I use repl.it to host my bot, as it is 100% free and runs 24/7. Go to https://replit.com/~ and make an account. Make a new repl, click import from github and paste https://github.com/fiercool/TheLonelyDiscordBot.

I host my bot on repl.it.%

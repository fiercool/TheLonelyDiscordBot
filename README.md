##How to run. 
###How to make a discord bot. 
Firstly set up a discord bot by going [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
Then click "New Application" in the top right, and pick any name you'd like. 
Click on the bot tab, and add a bot. 
Then copy the token as we'll need it for later.


I host my bot on repl.it.
